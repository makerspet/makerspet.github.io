<p>We may use web beacons (single-pixel gifs) that are contained within email. When your browser an email that contains a web beacon, it automatically connects to the web server that hosts the image (typically hosted by a third party). This allows that web server to log information about your device and to set and read its own cookies. We use web beacons, for example, to deliver cookies, count visits, understand if an email has been opened and acted upon.

<p></p>
<h4 class="h4">Use of cookies</h4>

<p>We use cookies, mobile analytics, advertising IDs, and similar technologies to operate our website and online services and to help collect data, including other identifiers and device information and usage data.</p>

<p>Many web browsers accept cookies by default. Users can usually change their browser's settings to reject and/or to remove many cookies. Please note also that choosing to reject or remove cookies may prevent certain features or services of our site from working properly.</p>

<p></p>
<h4 class="h4">Sharing personal information</h4>

<p>California Do Not Sell My Info</p>

<p>The California Consumer Protection Act (“CCPA”) requires us to disclose categories of personal information sold to third parties and how to opt-out of sale. The CCPA defines personal information to include online identifiers, including IP address, cookies IDs, and mobile IDs. The law also defines a "sale" to include simply making data available to third parties</p>

<p>Because we let advertising and analytics providers collect IP addresses, cookie IDs, mobile IDs through our sites and apps when you use our online services, but do not "sell" any other types of personal information, we provide our “Do Not Sell My Info” disclosures in this section.</p>

<p>We share personal data with your consent or as necessary to complete your transactions or provide the products you have requested or authorized, including with vendors or agents working on our behalf for the purposes described in this privacy notice (including above in the cookies section). For example, when you provide payment data for a purchase, that information will be processed by a payment processor who may use the information as necessary for payment processing, fraud prevention, or related financial services.</p>

<p>Although some of your data may be processed by third parties through the use of behavioral and analytics data described above, we do not otherwise sell, trade, or rent user personally identifiable information to others.</p>

<p>We may surrender personal information data in response to a valid legal warrant.</p>

<p>iOS and Android operating systems provide options to limit tracking and/or reset the advertising IDs.</p>

<p>Most email clients have settings which allow you prevent the automatic downloading of images, which will disable web beacons in the email messages you read.</p>

<p></p>
<h4 class="h4">Using personal information</h4>

<p>We collect and process personal information about you with your consent and/or as necessary to provide the products you use, fulfil your order, provide you with support, operate our business, meet our contractual and legal obligations, to prevent fraud, abuse and protect the security of our systems and our customers, to send periodic emails and otherwise communicate with you through confirmations, invoices, notices, alerts, and administrative messages, for marketing and advertising and to fulfil other legitimate interests. We may/will also contact you in case we learn that our user data becomes compromised.</p>

<p>We use a variety of third-party services including payment gateways, shipping providers, content-distribution networks, advertisers, analytics, and monitoring tools. Some of these services store information about users, and may track individuals across sites, applications, and services. These services may collect information in a similar manner as described above, including, for example, IP address, access times, browser type, language, device type, and device identifiers. They can also create inferences about you from this information. By interacting with our services, certain information about user devices may be exposed to third party advertising and analytics using cookies and other tracking mechanism, these third parties include the entities in the charts below.</p>

<p></p>

<h4 class="h4">Retention of Personal Information</h4>

<p>We retain personal information for as long as necessary to provide the products and fulfill the transactions you have requested, or for other essential purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements.</p>

<p>Since we use GitHub Pages as our website provider, we do not have access or retain the web server log.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Essentially all personal information that Maker's Pet collects - using its third-party services - is stored with Maker's Pet third-party services listed in this Privacy Notice. Maker's Pet business itself is located in the USA.</p>

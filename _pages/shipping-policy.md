<h4 class="h4">Processing Times</h4>

<p>We process orders typically within 1-2 business days. Orders requiring 3D-printing a part may take some additional time.
We will notify you if there is a considerable processing delay.</p>

<p>Once we ship your order, we will send you an email with tracking information - if your choice of shipping comes with tracking. You can also check your order status by logging into your account.</p>

<h4 class="h4">Domestic Shipping Options and Times</h4>

<ul>
  <li>UPS 2nd Day Air</li>
  <li>UPS Ground</li>
  <li>UPS Next Day Air</li>
  <li>UPS Standard</li>
  <li>USPS Priority Mail</li>
  <li>USPS Ground Advantage</li>
</ul>

<p>USPS usually costs less and does not always provide detailed tracking.
For domestic orders, UPS is sometimes faster and a little more expensive,
but has a high-quality tracking system. We recommend choosing UPS for your shipping.</p>

<p>For UPS shipping services, the actual weight of the package is rounded up to the next whole pound. Shipping carriers also use "dimensional weight" that reflects package size to calculate shipping costs.</p>

<p>We ship from California, USA and do not offer "drop shipping".</p>

<p>All of the quoted transit times are in business days, and do not include weekends, US holidays, etc.</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that shipping service guarantees are suspended if delays are caused by bad weather or other disasters. We cannot refund shipping fees if your package arrives late due to snow, natural disasters or other obstacles anywhere along your package's route.</p>

<p>We do not ship to hotels or mail forwarders. We may not be able to ship to PO Boxes depending on location or if there are known issues with the location. Not all shipping options are available to all locations. If shipping / billing names do not match or the payment method is outside the USA we may cancel the order.</p>

<p>Returns for Purchase Orders are store credit only.</p>

<p>Customers are responsible for both the return shipping costs and shipping costs from the original order unless the product arrives damaged or defective.</p>

<p>Refunds for goods originally using a free shipping method will be made less the actual carrier shipping cost.</p>

<p>Please contact us <b>before</b> returning any package. Contact us if you have any issues and we will do our best to help you out.</p>


<h4 class="h4">Changing or Canceling an Order</h4>

<p>If your order has not shipped, email us (support at makerspet.com) and we will do our best to change or cancel your order.
That said, we cannot guarantee the requested change or cancellation.</p>


<h4 class="h4">Pre-Orders</h4>

<p>Some products may be listed for pre-orders, including new products and products that are temporarily out of stock (backorder).</p>

<p>Please note that once you have completed the checkout process with a pre-ordered item, you will be charged immediately and your item will ship as soon as it is in stock. If the pre-ordered item will ship separately at a later date, the pre-ordered item's shipping may require shipping charges separate from in-stock items within the same order.</p>


<h4 class="h4">Domestic Sales Tax</h4>

<p>Domestic sales tax is applied only if the shipping destination address is in California. We do not collect any tax you live in any other state or outside USA.<p>

<p>To get sales tax exemption, email us (support at makerspet.com) a fully-filled out copy of your most recent Tax Exempt Certificate, with our information included in the Seller Fields. Once process your data, your orders will be tax exempt.</p>


<h4 class="h4">Payments</h4>

<p>Our online store uses third-party payment processors including <a href="https://square.com/">Square</a>, <a href="https://paypal.com">PayPal</a> and <a href="https://www.lightspeedhq.com/ecom/lightspeed-payments/">Lightspeed Payments</a>.</p>


<h4 class="h4">International Shipping</h4>

<ul>
  <li>UPS Worldwide Saver</li>
  <li>UPS Standard (ships to Canada)</li>
  <li>USPS First-Class Package International Service</li>
  <li>USPS Priority Mail International</li>
</ul>


<p>Please note:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You are responsible for any VAT, tariff, duty, taxes, handling fees, brokerage charges, customs clearance charges, etc. required by your country for importing consumer goods.</li>
  <li>For EU customers: if a product description does NOT mention CE certification - that product is NOT CE certified. Same goes for RoHS and REACH declarations.
  <ul>
    <li>Final products (e.g. a fully-functioning robot) and kits of final products must be CE certified in order to be sold in Europe. Therefore, we cannot sell/ship final non-CE-certified products to EU.</li>
    <li>However, electronic components - including PCB boards, PCB accessories (e.g. cables), etc. - are sold as "sub-assemblies". We are not legal experts, but to the best of our knowledge, there are exemptions to having CE certification for sub-assemblies sold to EU. The onus of certifying the final product (one that contains a non-CE-marked sub-assembly) is on the sub-assembly user. As far as we know, DIY hobbyists (also known as "radio amateurs") are typically exempt from certification requirements as long as the final product is not offered for sale or made in significant quantities. Please do consult an expert.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>FCC certification for US customers: if a product description does NOT mention FCC certification - that product is NOT FCC certified.
  <ul>
    <li>Similar to CE certification regulations, as far as we know, there are exemptions from FCC certification for sub-assemblies sold in USA. The sub-assembly user has to take care of FCC certification - with the exceptions for DIY hobbyists mentioned above.</li>
    <li>For example, Let's say you purchase an Arduino LiDAR/motor expansion board (a sub-assembly) and an ESP32 development board. Let's say you plug the ESP32 development board into the expansion board, add motors, wheels, a battery, a LiDAR and place the whole thing into a plastic enclosure. Let's say this is your final product that you'd like to offer for sale in the US. If you take this product to an FCC-accredited EMC testing lab, your ESP32-and-expansion-board assembly may (will, according to our experience) fail at least some FCC tests and limits. However, if you enclose your assembly into, say, an additional RF shield - say, while leaving the ESP32 RF antenna outside - now your final product might pass FCC tests. Therefore, it is up to you - not the sub-assembly vendor - to correctly engineer, select components, test and certify your final product.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>USPS First-Class does not provide tracking or delivery estimate</li>
</ul>

<p>Since we are a US-based busines, we follow the relevant US export laws and regulations. Therefore:
<ul>
  <li>We are unable to ship anything to countries embargoed by the US government - including Iran, North Korea, Sudan, Syria, Russia, Cuba and specific regions of Ukraine (Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk). If you place an order to be shipped to a restricted country/region, we will have to cancel that order and issue a refund</li>
  <li>Some of the items we may sell may be categorized as <a href="https://www.bis.gov/ear/title-15/subtitle-b/chapter-vii/subchapter-c/part-730/ss-7303-dual-use-and-other-types-items">dual-use technology</a>. If you order a dual-use item, we may have to reach out to you directly for further information before finalizing your order.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>In general, we are unable to predict your country's specific customs/duty/fee requirements. Therefore, please be prepared to pay VAT on the fully declared value of your order. Similarly, please be prepared to pay customs fees your country's postal system may charge you.</p>

<p>We cannot issue any refunds if you do not pay the required brokerage fees, VAT, tariff, duty, taxes, handling fees, customs clearance charges, etc.</p>

<p>Our customs forms will accurately describe the contents and cost of your order. We don't permit marking orders as "gift", "sample", "educational" or lower the values.</p>


<h4 class="h4">Delivery Signature</h4>

<p>All US orders are shipped "Signature Not Required" by default. However, the shipping company may decide to require a signature depending on the value or destination. If you want your order to require a signature for delivery, please contact Customer Support. If a "Signature Not Required" package is left at the door but isn’t there when you get home, neither Maker's Pet nor the shipping company can be held responsible.</p>

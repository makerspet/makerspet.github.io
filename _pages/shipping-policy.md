<h4 class="h4">Processing Times</h4>

<p>We process orders typically within 1-2 business days. Orders requiring 3D-printing a part may take some additional time.
We will notify you if there is a considerable processing delay.</p>

<p>Once we ship your order, we will send you an email with tracking information - if your choice of shipping comes with tracking. You can also check your order status by logging into your account.</p>

<h4 class="h4">Shipping Options and Times</h4>

<ul>
  <li>UPS 2nd Day Air</li>
  <li>UPS Ground</li>
  <li>UPS Next Day Air</li>
  <li>UPS Standard</li>
  <li>USPS Priority Mail</li>
  <li>USPS Ground Advantage</li>
  <li>USPS Express Mail</li>
</ul>

<p>USPS usually costs less and does not always provide detailed tracking. 
For domestic orders, UPS is sometimes faster and a little more expensive, but has a high-quality tracking system. We recommend choosing UPS for your shipping.</p>

<p>For UPS shipping services, the actual weight of the package is rounded up to the next whole pound. Shipping carriers also use "dimensional weight" that reflects package size to calculate shipping costs.</p>

<p>We do not offer "drop shipping".</p>

<p>All of the quoted transit times are in business days, and do not include weekends, US holidays, etc.</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that shipping service guarantees are suspended if delays are caused by bad weather or other disasters. We cannot refund shipping fees if your package arrives late due to snow, natural disasters or other obstacles anywhere along your package's route.</p>

<p>We do not ship to hotels or mail forwarders. We may not be able to ship to PO Boxes depending on location or if there are known issues with the location. Not all shipping options are available to all locations. If shipping / billing names do not match or the payment method is outside the USA we may cancel the order.</p>

<h4 class="h4">Returns</h4>

<p>To arrange for a return, please email support at makerspet.com. We can only accept returns of unopened kits and products, within <b>30 days of receipt</b> (for international orders, 30 days from shipment).</p>

<p>Any returns after 30 days are in store credit <b>only if the return is approved in advance</b>. We do not accept any returns on orders that are over 6 months old.</p>

<p>Returns for Purchase Orders are store credit only.</p>

<p>Customers are responsible for both the return shipping costs and shipping costs from the original order unless the product arrives damaged or defective.</p>

<p>Please contact us <b>before</b> returning any package. Contact us if you have any issues and we will do our best to help you out.</p>


<h4 class="h4">Changing or Canceling an Order</h4>

<p>If your order has not shipped, email us (support at makerspet.com) and we will do our best to change or cancel your order.
That said, we cannot guarantee the requested change or cancellation.</p>


<h4 class="h4">Pre-Orders</h4>

<p>Some products may be listed for pre-orders, including new products and products that are temporarily out of stock (backorder).</p>

<p>Please note that once you have completed the checkout process with a pre-ordered item, you will be charged immediately and your item will ship as soon as it is in stock. If the pre-ordered item will ship separately at a later date, the pre-ordered item's shipping may require shipping charges separate from in-stock items within the same order.</p>


<h4 class="h4">Domestic Sales Tax</h4>

<p>Domestic sales tax rates vary depending on location. Our online store solution provider
<a href="https://ecwid.com">Ecwid</a> calculates domestic sales tax automatically for us.</p>

<p>To get sales tax exemption, email us (support at makerspet.com) a fully-filled out copy of your most recent Tax Exempt Certificate, with our information included in the Seller Fields. Once process your data, your orders will be tax exempt.</p>


<h4 class="h4">Payments</h4>

<p>Our online store uses third-party payment processors including <a href="https://square.com/">Square</a>, <a href="https://paypal.com">PayPal</a> and <a href="https://www.lightspeedhq.com/ecom/lightspeed-payments/">Lightspeed Payments</a>.</p>


<h4 class="h4">International Shipping</h4>

<p>For the time being we ship in the USA only. We intend to start shipping internationally once we figure out the relevant certifications and logistics.</p>

<p>Once international shipping becomes available, you are responsible for any VAT, tariff, duty, taxes, handling fees, brokerage charges, customs clearance charges, etc. required by your country for importing consumer goods.</p>

<p>In general, Maker's Pet (the shipper) is unable to predict your country's customs/fee requirements. Therefore, be prepared to pay full VAT on the fully declared value of your order as well as any customs fees your country's postal system may charge you.</p>

<p>We cannot issue any refunds if you do not pay the required brokerage fees, VAT, tariff, duty, taxes, handling fees, customs clearance charges, etc.</p>

<p>Our customs forms will accurately describe the contents and cost of your order. We don't permit marking orders as "gift", "sample", "educational" or lower the values.</p>


<h4 class="h4">Signature Requirements</h4>

<p>All US orders are shipped "Signature Not Required" by default. However, the shipping company may decide to require a signature depending on the value or destination. If you want your order to require a signature for delivery, please contact Customer Support. If a "Signature Not Required" package is left at the door but isnâ€™t there when you get home, neither Maker's Pet nor the shipping company can be held responsible.</p>

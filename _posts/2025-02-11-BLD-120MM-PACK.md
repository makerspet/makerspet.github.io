## FAQ and Troubleshooting

### Where to Get Technical support

- [Support forum](https://github.com/makerspet/support/discussions)

### How do I Troubleshoot the Robot

Watch Maker's Pet YouTube videos for troubleshooting tips.

- Debug ESP32-related issues using the Arduino Serial Monitor.
  - Connect ESP32 dev board to your PC
  - Open the Arduino Serial Monitor.
  - Make sure your Serial Monitor baud rate is set to 115200.
  - Inspect the Serial Monitor output.
  - Press the ESP32 reset (EN) button to reboot ESP32.

- Debug ROS2-related issues using ROS2 tools
  - Inspect the command shell output.
  - Read ROS2 documentation.

### docker run Fails on Windows PC

PS C:\Users\ilya>
```

Solution - looks like your Docker engine is not running. Launch Docker Desktop on your Windows PC.

### Windows WSL2 Install Fails

- Follow [Microsoft WSL Installation instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
- Check [Microsoft WSL Troubleshooting instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/troubleshooting)

### ROS2 GUI not Showing on Windows PC

Make sure you have launched the X server on your Windows PC.

### Robot's Motor(s) Appear to Malfunction

- Make sure the battery power switch is ON.
- Make sure the battery is connected to the board and the batteries are not low.
  - Check that the power LED on the ESP32 board lights up when the battery power switch is ON.
- Common issue: double check motor connections
  - The motor connector housing can slide off, towards the motor's magnet.
Pull the connector housing carefully back into place.
  - Make sure the motor wires are connected to the correct board screw terminals.
  - The screw terminals connections can fail, e.g. wire breaks off,
metal conductors fail to make a contact, etc. Follow instructions in
the [assembly video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/6GtjAB19GP8) to make reliable wire connections.
- Check the green LED light on the motor. The green LED is OFF means the motor's encoder
is not getting its power. For example, because the battery is disconnected,
the power switch is off, the motor-to-cable connection failed, the cable-to-board connection failed, etc.

Run the teleop app (ROS2), press the `w` key to make the robot's motor rotate forward.
- If a motor does not move
  - Check for cables accidentally blocking the rotation of the motor's encoder magnet
  - Check that neither of the motors is somehow mechanically stalled
  - Check the motor M1 and M2 are connected to the board reliably
  - Check that the batteries are fresh

- If one motor works, but the other one does not
  - try swapping motors, see the [assembly video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/6GtjAB19GP8)

- If a motor keeps rotating full speed in one direction only,
no matter what the teleop command is (forward, backward, stop, etc.)
  - Try swapping the motor's ENCA and ENCB encoder wires.
  - Check if both encoder wires are connected reliably.

- If a motor rotates at full speed only, but changes its direction on teleop commands
  - Check if one of the encoder wires has a bad connection (to the board and/or to the motor).

- If a motor rotates in the opposite direction, but otherwise responds correctly
to the teleop commands
  - Try swapping the motor's ENCA and ENCB encoder wires. Next, swap the motor's
M1 and M2 wires.

- If a motor rotates "unevenly"
  - Check for flaky wire connections
  - If your are using third-party motor, i.e. not purchased at Maker's Pet,
you may need to tune your motors' PID coefficient in the config.yaml driver board file.

### ESP32 Upload Fails

Your sketch compiles successfully, but Arduino IDE shows this error:

```
esptool.py v4.5.3
Serial port COM3
Connecting......................................

A fatal error occurred: Failed to connect to ESP32: No serial data received.
For troubleshooting steps visit: Troubleshooting - ESP32 - — esptool.py latest documentation
The selected serial port For troubleshooting steps visit: Troubleshooting - ESP32 - — esptool.py latest documentation
is not present or the board is not connected
```

This is a common problem. Retry the upload. When `Connecting..` appears,
immediately press the BOOT button on your ESP32 board. Keep holding BOOT for 3-5 seconds.
Release the BOOT button and your upload should, hopefully, succeed this time.

Same applies to ESP32 sketch data uploads.

### Robot's ESP32 Fails to Connect to WiFi

- Make sure the WiFi credentials you provided to your ESP32 during the web config are correct.
- Try pressing the reset (EN) button on your ESP32.
This often fixes WiFi connection failure problems as long as the WiFi has been configured correctly.
- Make sure your WiFi is 2.4GHz - NOT 5GHz. ESP32 supports 2.4GHz WiFi only.
- Do the WiFi configuration reset (see this FAQ) followed by the web WiFi config.
Make sure the WiFi credentials you provide to your ESP32 are correct.

### Robot's ESP32 Connects to WiFi, but Fails to Connect to the Windows ROS2 PC

- Make sure you have launched the `kaiaai/kaiaai:iron` image in Docker
- Inside the Docker container running the `kaiaai/kaiaai:iron` image, make sure you have launched `ros2 launch kaiaai_bringup physical.launch.py`
- Make sure both your robot and your PC are connected to the same local WiFi network
- Make sure your local WiFi network allows devices to connect to each other and does not block ports. For example, WiFi networks in cafes, restaurants often block local-device-to-local-device connections.
- Make sure your PC does not block incoming local connections.

### How to Perform WiFi Configuration Reset

- Power up your ESP32 dev board (e.g. using USB or battery power)
- Press the reset (EN) button on your ESP32 dev board
- Within 1 second or less, press and hold the BOOT button on your ESP32 dev board
The ESP32 activity LED should start blinking very fast
- Keep pressing the BOOT button for a few seconds until the ESP32 activity LED turns solid on.
- Release the BOOT button. Your ESP32 should reboot and restart in the AP (WiFi configuration) mode.

### Arduino IDE Fails to Detect ESP32 COM Port

- Make sure your ESP32 is powered up and its power LED indicator is on.
- Check if your ESP32-to-PC USB cable is damaged. Try replacing your USB cable.
- Check if your ESP32-to-PC USB cable is for CHARGING ONLY. Try replacing your USB cable with a regular one.
- Sometimes ESP32 dev board's USB-to-serial hardware can fail.
  - Try connecting your ESP32 to another PC.
  - Try connecting another ESP32 to your PC.

### Arduino IDE 2.x SPIFFS Upload Fails - COM Port not Found

Error in Arduino IDE attempting a SPIFFS upload:

```
SPIFFS Filesystem Uploader

Using partition: default
ERROR: No port specified, check IDE menus
```

Solution - restart your Arduino IDE and retry SPIFFS upload.

```

Solution:
- Close the Serial Monitor window in your Arduino IDE
- Make sure your ESP32 is connected to the PC
- Make sure your ESP32 USB serial port is not malfunctioning
  - Try another PC
  - Try another ESP32

### Arduino IDE 2.x SPIFFS Upload Fails - COM Port not specified

- Restart your Arduino IDE

## ESP32 Activity LED Status

- Solid ON - AP mode
- Slow blinking, once per second - connecting to WiFi
- Very slow blinking, once per 20 seconds - connected to WiFi, connecting to ROS2 PC

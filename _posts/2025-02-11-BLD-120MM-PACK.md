## FAQ and Troubleshooting

### Where to Get Technical support

- [Support forum](https://github.com/makerspet/support/discussions)

### Can I use 18650 Li-Ion batteries instead of 6xAA?

Although Maker's Pet boards can be powered using various power sources, Maker's Pet BDC-30P, BDC-38C4 motor driver boards are designed to work with non-rechargeable alkaline batteries. There is no on-board protection for use with rechargeable batteries. Rechargeable batteries can be dangerous when mishandled.

If you do choose to power the BDC-30P board using rechargeable batteries instead of non-rechargeable, the 120mm base is large enough to accomodate a 2-cell 18650 battery holder. Also:
- IMPORTANT: the cells would have to protected and connected in series
  - specifically, the cells must be protected from short circuit, overcurrent, overcharge, overdischarge, etc.
- you would have to remove spent batteries from the battery holder and charge the batteries using your own battery charger
- when you select cell brand/type/size/amperage/capacity, keep in mind the robot's maximum power consumption of around 3A continuous and around 5A current. For typical power consumption, see the power consumption section in this post.

Use of rechargeable batteries is at YOUR OWN RISK.

### How do I Troubleshoot the Robot

Watch Maker's Pet YouTube videos for troubleshooting tips.

- Debug ESP32-related issues using the Arduino Serial Monitor.
  - Connect ESP32 dev board to your PC
  - Open the Arduino Serial Monitor.
  - Make sure your Serial Monitor baud rate is set to 115200.
  - Inspect the Serial Monitor output.
  - Press the ESP32 reset (EN) button to reboot ESP32.

- Debug ROS2-related issues using ROS2 tools
  - Inspect the command shell output.
  - Read ROS2 documentation.

### docker run Fails on Windows PC

```
PowerShell 7.5.0
PS C:\Users\ilya> docker run --name makerspet -it --rm -p 8888:8888/udp -p 4430:4430/tcp -e DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0.0 -e LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=0 kaiaai/kaiaai:iron
docker: error during connect: Head "http://%2F%2F.%2Fpipe%2FdockerDesktopLinuxEngine/_ping": open //./pipe/dockerDesktopLinuxEngine: The system cannot find the file specified.
See 'docker run --help'.
PS C:\Users\ilya>
```

Solution - looks like your Docker engine is not running. Launch Docker Desktop on your Windows PC.

```
PowerShell 7.5.0
PS C:\Users\ilya> docker run --name makerspet -it --rm -p 8888:8888/udp -p 4430:4430/tcp -e DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0.0 -e LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=0 kaiaai/kaiaai:iron
docker: Error response from daemon: Ports are not available: exposing port TCP 0.0.0.0:4430 -> 0.0.0.0:0: listen tcp 0.0.0.0:4430: bind: An attempt was made to access a socket in a way forbidden by its access permissions.
PS C:\Users\ilya>
```

Solution - try rebooting your Windows PC.

```
docker: Error response from daemon: Conflict. The container name "/makerspet" is already in use by container "e86601354246103f6d55f008b488bc4551f429c0de6dd37f22dca0932759e38d". You have to remove (or rename) that container to be able to reuse that name.
See 'docker run --help'.
```

Your container is already running - or was not shut down and is still running from your last invocation. When shutting down a container, be sure to exit all shells - as opposed to just closing the PowerShell window.

Solution - stop the container and retry your `docker run`.

```
docker container stop makerspet
```

### docker pull Fails on Windows PC

```
PS C:\Users\ilya> docker pull kaiaai/kaiaai:iron
error during connect: Post "http://%2F%2F.%2Fpipe%2FdockerDesktopLinuxEngine/v1.47/images/create?fromImage=kaiaai%2Fkaiaai&tag=iron": open //./pipe/dockerDesktopLinuxEngine: The system cannot find the file specified.
PS C:\Users\ilya>
```

Solution - looks like your Docker engine is not running. Launch Docker Desktop on your Windows PC.

### ROS2 Command Fails

Launching RViz (or any GUI) fails when using Windows WSL:

```
root@9e260228a03a:/ros_ws# ros2 launch kaiaai_bringup monitor_robot.launch.py

```

Solution: make sure your X server is running before launching any GUI program.

A ROS2 command does not exit even after pressing Ctrl-C.

Solution - kill ROS2 processes from another Bash window.
For example, `ps -al` shows process number 272 running `ros2` and
process 334 running `python3`. Stop both those processes as shown below.

```
root@8ec422cb4258:/ros_ws# ps -al
F S   UID   PID  PPID  C PRI  NI ADDR SZ WCHAN  TTY          TIME CMD
4 S     0   272     1  0  80   0 - 107559 -     pts/0    00:00:00 ros2
4 S     0   334     1  0  80   0 - 210129 x64_sy pts/2   00:00:01 python3

root@8ec422cb4258:/ros_ws# kill 334
root@8ec422cb4258:/ros_ws# kill 272
```

### Windows WSL2 Install Fails

- Follow [Microsoft WSL Installation instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
- Check [Microsoft WSL Troubleshooting instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/troubleshooting)

### ROS2 GUI not Showing on Windows PC

Make sure you have launched the X server on your Windows PC.

### Robot's Motor(s) Appear to Malfunction

- Make sure the battery power switch is ON.
- Make sure the battery is connected to the board and the batteries are not low.
  - Check that the power LED on the ESP32 board lights up when the battery power switch is ON.
- Common issue: double check motor connections
  - The motor connector housing can slide off, towards the motor's magnet.
Pull the connector housing carefully back into place.
  - Make sure the motor wires are connected to the correct board screw terminals.
  - The screw terminals connections can fail, e.g. wire breaks off,
metal conductors fail to make a contact, etc. Follow instructions in
the [assembly video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GtjAB19GP8&list=PLOSXKDW70aR8uA1IFahSKVuk5ODDfjTZV) to make reliable wire connections.
- Check the green LED light on the motor. The green LED is OFF means the motor's encoder
is not getting its power. For example, because the battery is disconnected,
the power switch is off, the motor-to-cable connection failed, the cable-to-board connection failed, etc.
- keep debris out of the gearbox. Debris in the gearbox can make the gears seize and the motor burn out.
- make sure the motor screws are not overtightened. Tight screws can bend the plastic (including the robot base), making the plastic catch the motor gears and/or the encoder disk. That can, in turn, cause the motor to burn out.

Run the teleop app (ROS2), press the `w` key to make the robot's motor rotate forward.
- If a motor does not move
  - Check for cables accidentally blocking the rotation of the motor's encoder magnet
  - Check that neither of the motors is somehow mechanically stalled
  - Check the motor M1 and M2 are connected to the board reliably
  - Check that the batteries are fresh

- If one motor works, but the other one does not
  - try swapping motors, see the [assembly video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GtjAB19GP8&list=PLOSXKDW70aR8uA1IFahSKVuk5ODDfjTZV)

- If a motor keeps rotating full speed in one direction only,
no matter what the teleop command is (forward, backward, stop, etc.)
  - Try swapping the motor's ENCA and ENCB encoder wires.
  - Check if both encoder wires are connected reliably.

- If a motor rotates at full speed only, but changes its direction on teleop commands
  - Check if one of the encoder wires has a bad connection (to the board and/or to the motor).

- If a motor rotates in the opposite direction, but otherwise responds correctly
to the teleop commands
  - Try swapping the motor's ENCA and ENCB encoder wires. Next, swap the motor's
M1 and M2 wires.

- If a motor rotates "unevenly"
  - Check for flaky wire connections
  - If your are using third-party motor, i.e. not purchased at Maker's Pet,
you may need to tune your motors' PID coefficient in the config.yaml driver board file.

- Motor changes speed abruptly
  - check the motor encoder components soldering; carefully solder any loose components

Install `pyserial` on your Ubuntu machine, see instructions in the [Ubuntu software setup video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHPyjVdTNg4&list=PLOSXKDW70aR8uA1IFahSKVuk5ODDfjTZV).
```
sudo apt install -y python3-pip
pip3 install pyserial
```

### ESP32 Upload Fails

Your sketch compiles successfully, but Arduino IDE shows this error:

```
esptool.py v4.5.3
Serial port COM3
Connecting......................................

A fatal error occurred: Failed to connect to ESP32: No serial data received.
For troubleshooting steps visit: Troubleshooting - ESP32 - — esptool.py latest documentation
The selected serial port For troubleshooting steps visit: Troubleshooting - ESP32 - — esptool.py latest documentation
is not present or the board is not connected
```

This is a common problem. Retry the upload. When `Connecting..` appears,
immediately press the BOOT button on your ESP32 board. Keep holding BOOT for 3-5 seconds.
Release the BOOT button and your upload should, hopefully, succeed this time.

Same applies to ESP32 sketch data uploads.

### Firmware Upload Successful Without Pressing BOOT Button

This is fine, you don't have to press the BOOT button if firmware upload succeeds without the BOOT button press.

Some ESP32 development boards require the BOOT button to be pressed for 3-5 seconds to begin firmware download.
Other ESP32 development boards do not require pressing the BOOT button.

### Robot's ESP32 Fails to Connect to WiFi

- Make sure the WiFi credentials you provided to your ESP32 during the web config are correct.
- Try pressing the reset (EN) button on your ESP32.
This often fixes WiFi connection failure problems as long as the WiFi has been configured correctly.
- Make sure your WiFi is 2.4GHz - NOT 5GHz. ESP32 supports 2.4GHz WiFi only.
- Do the WiFi configuration reset (see this FAQ) followed by the web WiFi config.
Make sure the WiFi credentials you provide to your ESP32 are correct.

### Robot's ESP32 Connects to WiFi, but Fails to Connect to the Windows ROS2 PC

- Make sure you have launched the `kaiaai/kaiaai:iron` image in Docker
- Inside the Docker container running the `kaiaai/kaiaai:iron` image, make sure you have launched `ros2 launch kaiaai_bringup physical.launch.py`
- Make sure both your robot and your PC are connected to the same local WiFi network
- Make sure your local WiFi network allows devices to connect to each other and does not block ports. For example, WiFi networks in cafes, restaurants, universities often block local-device-to-local-device connections.
- Make sure your PC does not block incoming local connections.
- Check the IP address of your ROS2 PC in case the ROS2 PC IP address has changed. If that happens, perform the ESP32 WiFi configuration reset - as described above - and enter the new ROS2 PC address.

### How to Perform WiFi Configuration Reset

- Power up your ESP32 dev board (e.g. using USB or battery power)
- Press the reset (EN) button on your ESP32 dev board
- Within 1 second or less, press and hold the BOOT button on your ESP32 dev board
The ESP32 activity LED should start blinking very fast
- Keep pressing the BOOT button for a few seconds until the ESP32 activity LED turns solid on.
- Release the BOOT button. Your ESP32 should reboot and restart in the AP (WiFi configuration) mode.

### Arduino IDE Fails to Detect ESP32 COM Port

- Make sure your ESP32 is powered up and its power LED indicator is on.
- Check if your ESP32-to-PC USB cable is damaged. Try replacing your USB cable.
- Check if your ESP32-to-PC USB cable is for CHARGING ONLY. Try replacing your USB cable with a regular one.
- Sometimes ESP32 dev board's USB-to-serial hardware can fail.
  - Try connecting your ESP32 to another PC.
  - Try connecting another ESP32 to your PC.

### Arduino IDE 2.x SPIFFS Upload Fails - COM Port not Found

Error in Arduino IDE attempting a SPIFFS upload:

```

## LiDAR Debug

### Checking LiDAR startup

Once you have connected your robot to your ROS2 PC, your LiDAR should be spinning.
If your LiDAR is not spinning at this point
- check the LiDAR wire connections.
- make sure you are using a supported LiDAR model. See the list of supported LiDAR models [here](https://github.com/kaiaai/kaiaai).
- make sure your firmware and ROS2 software has been configured to match your LiDAR model. See below for more details.
  - By default, the firmware and the ROS2 software are configured to use LD14P.

### Checking LiDAR data capture

With your robot connected to your ROS2 PC and your LiDAR spinning, make sure your LiDAR is capturing data successfully.

Check the Arduino Serial Monitor and pay attention to `LiDAR RPM` - it should NOT be zero, see example below.

```
Telem avg 46 max 52ms, LiDAR RPM 4.75, wheels RPM 0.00 0.00, battery 8.00V, RSSI -61dBm
Telem avg 46 max 52ms, LiDAR RPM 4.75, wheels RPM 0.00 0.00, battery 8.00V, RSSI -62dBm
```

If `LiDAR RPM` IS zero, as shown below, something is wrong with with your LiDAR capturing data.

```
Telem avg 50 max 51ms, LiDAR RPM 0.00, wheels RPM 0.00 0.00, battery 0.99V, RSSI -59dBm
Telem avg 50 max 51ms, LiDAR RPM 0.00, wheels RPM 0.00 0.00, battery 0.99V, RSSI -58dBm
```

Follow the steps listed above - check LiDAR connections and LiDAR model configuration - to debug the data capture issue.

### Checking LiDAR data streaming

Once your LiDAR captures data successfully, connect your robot to your ROS2 PC and launch Rviz to view robot LiDAR output in Rviz using `ros2 launch kaiaai_bringup monitor_robot.launch.py` command.

You should see LiDAR points displayed live, in real time. If you don't see the live data, check your ROS2 terminal output for errors

- pay attention to the LiDAR model printed in the terminal output
  - if your LiDAR model does NOT match the printed model, you have a ROS2 configuration issue. See below for more details.
- pay attention to message CRC and message dropped errors
  - unreliable and/or busy WiFi can cause these errors
  - ROS2 LiDAR model misconfiguration can also cause these errors

### Configuring LiDAR model

By default, the build pack is configured to use LD14P LiDAR. If you use a LiDAR other than LD14P, follow posts below for detailed instructions. The list of supported LiDAR models is [here](https://github.com/kaiaai/kaiaai).

## Mapping and Self-Driving

Prepare your place before doing mapping and/or self-driving as follows.

- LiDAR sensors have some limitations. Specifically, block objects that LiDARs cannot detect with, for example, cardboard:
  - non-reflective (black) objects
  - transparent objects
  - objects with height not enough to reach the LiDAR's laser plane
  - objects that are too small, e.g. fine sparse mesh 
  - objects illuminated too brightly using light sources that contain near-infrared spectra (e.g. sunlight, incandescent)
  - mirrors and highly reflective objects
- This particular robot is too small to navigate over thick carpet or traverse thresholds exceeding around 5mm (1/5")
- Keep the scene as static as possible during mapping. For example, don't open/close doors until the mapping process completes.
- I recommend decluttering your place before doing mapping and/or self-driving. Leave plenty of space between obstacles.
- Block off and don't let the robot drive over angled ramps. Angled flooring can tilt the LiDAR laser plane and mess up the mapping process.

### Goal Failed Errors

This error indicates that the robot is unable to find a safe path to the specified goal point. Often, this is caused by obstacles located too close to each other, so that the robot cannot safely "squeeze" between those obstacles on its way to the goal point.

The robot requires maintaining plenty of empty space around itself at all times. That is, when the robot plans out its driving path, if the robot comes too close to an obstacle (too close for the robot's "comfort") - without even touching the obstacle - the robot will still refuse to drive and report a Goal Failed error.

Here is what you can do to make these errors go away:

- Make sure you have a nice, clean map.
- Simplify your environment
  - Try removing obstacles.
  - Leave plenty of extra space between the remaining obstacles for the robot to drive around.

Here is an example of a nice, clean map.

![An example of a nice, clean map](/assets/images/webp/clean_map.webp 'An example of a nice, clean map'){:class="zoom-image"}

Goal navigation can also fail if your PC is too slow. Watch out for errors like "Transform data too old when converting from odom to map" indicating that the processing of the robot's real-time telemetry (odom) has taken too much time.


You can tune the mapping and navigation algorithm by adjusting values in the `navigation.yaml`. This file is located inside the Docker container here `/ros_ws/src/makerspet_mini/config/navigation.yaml`. You can also [view this file here](https://github.com/makerspet/makerspet_mini/blob/iron/config/navigation.yaml).

Here are some of the parameters you can tune:

- robot's speed during mapping and navigation
- the inflation radius (how far the robot should stay away from obstacles to avoid collisions)

Tuning the robot's mapping and navigation is an advanced topic that requires experimentation. Start by Googling `ROS2 Nav2 tuning` to find good tuning tutorials. If you find values that are better than the `navigation.yaml` defaults, please consider sharing your values in the [support forum](https://github.com/makerspet/support/discussions).


### My robot makes a knocking sound

If you 3D print the robot parts yourself, make sure to set Seam Position to Random in your slicer when printing the caster wheel. Without this setting the caster can make a rhythmic knocking sound.

Do the same when 3D printing wheels, otherwise your robot may end up wobbling slightly.

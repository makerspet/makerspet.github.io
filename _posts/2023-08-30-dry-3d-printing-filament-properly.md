If you 3D-print PLA only, I don't think you need a dryer. But if you print just about anything else - PETG, ABS, ASA, Nylon, TPU, polycarbonate and so on - keep reading!

Most 3d printing filaments, except PLA, are hygroscopic, i.e., they absorb moisture from the air. You can usually tell that your filament got moist by

- Hearing the distinct popcorn-popping sound as the filament makes its way through the 3D printer's extruder. The extruder quickly heats up tiny moisture pockets, turning them into little bubbles of compressed steam.
- Noticing your print having unusually many pockmarks left by the steam bubbles that have burst.
- Noticing atypically lots of stringing in your print.

I'm using an 1700W electric air fryer oven that I "borrowed" from my wife. The air fryer oven vendor and model are GoWISE USA AG89B. The oven has 1700W of power and a built-in air circulation fan. I'm not associated with GoWISE USA, I'm just describing my personal experience. I'm sure you can find similar fryers from other vendors - just try searching Amazon.

Here are instructions on using this oven to dry filament:

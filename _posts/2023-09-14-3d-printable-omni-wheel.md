This is a 12-roller robot 3D-printed DIY omni-wheel - a part of [Kiddo companion robot](/blog/2023-09-12-meet-kiddo-pet-robot-model/). This open-source design incudes 3MF, STL, STEP and SolidWorks files.

Included are 3 verions - as the omni-wheel design evolved:

1. Rollers coated in silicon rubber, 130mm OD - recommended
2. v2 - rollers in a 3D-printed TPU soft jacket, 130mm OD
3. v1 - rollers in a 3D-printed TPU soft jacket

<blockquote>{% include signup-form.html %}</blockquote>

All three omni-wheel version were 3D-printed on a Prusa MK3S.

I will write up instructions on DIY silicon rubber overmolding in a next article.

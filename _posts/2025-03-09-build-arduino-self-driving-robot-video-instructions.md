Here is my [video instructions series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GtjAB19GP8&list=PLOSXKDW70aR8uA1IFahSKVuk5ODDfjTZV&si=UG-gdWqQZZMGCvMy) with step-by-step explanations "How to Build an Arduino/ROS2 Self-driving Robot". Happy building!

There are five video lessons:

1) Self-driving robot assembly
2) Software and firmware setup
3) Robot bring-up
4) Create a map of your place (manual driving)
5) Robot self-drives to create a map, navigate your place automatically

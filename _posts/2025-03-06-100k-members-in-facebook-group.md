I've been running several Facebook groups related to Arduino, robotics, DIY and programming. Today my [Arduino and Robotics group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/351994643955858) has reached over 100K members ðŸ¥³ðŸŽ‰.

Also, my other Facebook group [Arduino and DIY Robots](https://www.facebook.com/groups/243730868651472) that focuses on DIY robots in a more narrow fashion.

Please visit and/or join my groups to
- learn Arduino and robotics and find free popular learning resources
- find a project you like
- get inspiration, motivation for your project
- see what's happening in Arduino and robotics around the world

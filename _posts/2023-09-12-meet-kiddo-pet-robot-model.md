Meet Kiddo - an open-source DIY 3D-printable home companion robot!

Kiddo comes with an omni-wheel base and an extendable mast. Note that the rubber-coated rollers are also DIY.

Kiddo was designed in Solidworks in 2020-2021 and printed using a Prusa MK3S and a Caribou 420 (a Prusa MK3S modded to increase its print volume height to 420mm).

Solidworks design files are available [here](https://github.com/makerspet/kiddo).

<blockquote>{% include signup-form.html %}</blockquote>

This is an early design that aimed to achieve superior agility. Its height was selected to match that of a 6-7 year-old child.

We placed this design on hold for now because it comes with extra complexity and cost, especially when building it DIY.

Watch Snoopy-the-pet-robot self-drive around a simulated living room,
hide under the table (as in hide-and-seek), play ball and "prompt" humans to play.

This is fraction of what your robot will be able to do.

The 3D VR simulation runs in ROS2 Gazebo simulator. You can find the step-by-step simulation tutorial
[here](https://kaia.ai/blog/gazebo-3d-simulation-tutorial).

## Snoopy plays ball, hides under the table
Disclaimer - I drive Snoopy manually here. I will be adding fully automatic behaviors later this year.
